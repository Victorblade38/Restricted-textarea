# Restricted Text Area

This Restricted Text Area component allows users to input text up to a specified limit, such as 100 words. Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a simple and user-friendly way to control the amount of text entered into the textarea. JavaScript is used to track the word count and prevent users from exceeding the specified limit. This can be useful for forms or applications where word limits are required.
